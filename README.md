## Overview
Loa is a programming language focused on simplicity, readability, and ease of use.
It is an interpreted language with a clean and minimal syntax, designed to make programming accessible and straightforward.
Loa supports basic programming constructs such as variables, conditionals, loops, and functions, making it suitable for a wide range of general-purpose tasks.

## Examples

### Simple print and variable usage

```loa
print("Hello, world!")

x = 10
y = 20
print(x + y)
```

### While loop example

```loa
x = 1
while (x <= 5):
    print(x)
    x = x + 1
```

### If / Else If / Else example

```loa
x = 5
y = 10

if (x < y):
    print("x is smaller than y")
else if (x == y):
    print("x and y are equal")
else:
    print("x is greater than y")
```

More examples are available inside `test/`.
